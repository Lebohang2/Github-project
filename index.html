      GitHub is an online platform where developers can store, share, and
      collaborate on coding projects. It uses a tool called Git to track changes
      in code over time, making it easy to manage versions and work with others.
      Developers create repositories (or “repos”) to organize their projects,
      and they can upload, update, and review code from anywhere. GitHub is
      widely used in both professional and learning environments, making it a
      valuable tool for showcasing work, contributing to open-source projects,
      and collaborating on software development.
